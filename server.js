  { _id: 1, image: '/images/reality_dysfunction.jpg', contributor: 'Noah', title: 'Reality Dysfunction', author: 'Peter Hamilton', genre: 'Science Fiction', notes: 'One of my favorite book of all times. Space opera meets satanism and zombies. Need I say more?', synopsis: 'Space is not the only void... In AD 2600 the human race is finally beginning to realize its full potential. Hundreds of colonized planets scattered across the galaxy host a multitude of prosperous and wildly diverse cultures. Genetic engineering has pushed evolution far beyond nature\'s boundaries, defeating disease and producing extraordinary spaceborn creatures. Huge fleets of sentient trader starships thrive on the wealth created by the industrialization of entire star systems. And throughout inhabited space the Confederation Navy keeps the peace. A true golden age is within our grasp. But now something has gone catastrophically wrong. On a primitive colony planet a renegade criminal\'s chance encounter with an utterly alien entity unleashes the most primal of all our fears. An extinct race which inhabited the galaxy aeons ago called it "The Reality Dysfunction." It is the nightmare which has prowled beside us since the beginning of history.' },
  { _id: 2, image: '/images/Conan_the_Barbarian.jpg', contributor: 'Noah', title: 'Conan the Barbarian', author: 'Robert E. Howard', genre: 'Fantasy', notes: 'Interesting combination of magic, horror and old timey pulp.', synopsis: 'Conan the Cimmerianâ€”the boy-thief who became a mercenary, who fought and loved his way across fabled lands to become King of Aquilonia. Neither supernatural fiends nor demonic sorcery could oppose the barbarian warrior as he wielded his mighty sword and dispatched his enemies to a bloody doom on the battlefields of the legendary Hyborian age.'},
  { _id: 3, image: '/images/sandman.jpg', contributor: 'Noah', title: 'The Sandman', author: 'Neil Gaiman', genre: 'Graphic Novel', notes: 'Anxtsy, compelling stories and varied art styles. It really takes me back to being a depressed adolescent.', synopsis: 'The Sandman is a comic book series written by Neil Gaiman and drawn by Sam Kieth, Mike Dringenberg, Jill Thompson, Shawn McManus, Marc Hempel and Michael Zulli and more, with covers by Dave McKean. Beginning with issue #47, it was placed under the imprint Vertigo. It chronicles the adventures of Dream (of the Endless), who rules over the world of dreams.'}
